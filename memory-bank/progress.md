## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- **Task System Incomplete**: Task management structure not yet implemented
- **No Examples**: System lacks concrete usage examples
- **Validation Missing**: No automated consistency checking
- **Limited Testing**: System not yet tested with actual memory reset scenarios

### Technical Debt
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Need automated checking of internal links
- **Template Standardization**: Some inconsistencies in section organization
- **Metadata Management**: Manual timestamp updates could be automated
- **Content Duplication**: Some information repeated across files

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Adoption Risk**: System might be too complex → Mitigation: Keep it simple, provide examples
- **Maintenance Risk**: Files might become outdated → Mitigation: Clear update procedures
- **Consistency Risk**: Information might diverge → Mitigation: Validation tools
- **Scalability Risk**: System might not scale → Mitigation: Modular design
