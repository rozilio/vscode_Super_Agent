# Project Brief

**Project Name:** Development Template  
**Created:** 2025-06-29  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-29

## Project Overview

This is a development template project designed to serve as a foundation for new software development projects. It provides a structured approach to project initialization with a comprehensive Memory Bank system that ensures continuity and effective collaboration between AI assistants and developers.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. **Memory Continuity**: Maintain perfect documentation that survives AI memory resets
2. **Project Structure**: Provide a standardized template for new development projects
3. **Documentation System**: Implement a hierarchical memory bank that captures all project context
4. **Task Management**: Enable systematic tracking of project tasks and progress

### Key Features
- Complete Memory Bank system with core and optional files
- Structured task management with individual task tracking
- Project intelligence capture through instructions
- Hierarchical documentation that builds context progressively

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Complete Memory Bank structure with all core files
- [ ] Task management system with index and individual task files
- [ ] Clear documentation hierarchy that enables effective AI collaboration
- [ ] Template structure that can be easily adapted for new projects

### Should Have
- [ ] Example task entries demonstrating the system
- [ ] Clear guidelines for maintaining the Memory Bank
- [ ] Integration with development workflows

### Could Have
- [ ] Additional context files for complex scenarios
- [ ] Automation scripts for Memory Bank maintenance
- [ ] Integration with external project management tools

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with standard file systems
- Should be platform-independent
- Must be maintainable through standard text editors

### Business Constraints
- Template should be generic enough for various project types
- Documentation overhead should be minimal
- System should scale from small to large projects

## Stakeholders

### Primary Users
- AI assistants (primary consumer of Memory Bank)
- Software developers (maintainers and beneficiaries)
- Project managers (oversight and planning)

### Secondary Users
- New team members (onboarding reference)
- Code reviewers (context understanding)

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Memory Bank system implementation
- Task management structure
- Documentation templates
- Basic project organization

### Out of Scope
- Specific technology implementations
- Actual application development
- External tool integrations
- Advanced automation features

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Initialize Memory Bank structure
- Create all core files
- Establish task management system

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Future)
- Add example content
- Refine documentation templates
- Test with real projects

### Phase 3: Optimization (Future)
- Streamline workflows
- Add automation where beneficial
- Gather feedback and iterate

## Notes

This project brief serves as the foundation for all other Memory Bank files. Any changes to core requirements or project direction should be reflected here first, then cascaded to dependent files.
