## Task Management Guidelines

### Creating New Tasks
1. Use sequential numbering (TASK002, TASK003, etc.)
2. Use descriptive, action-oriented names
3. Create individual task file in tasks/ directory
4. Update this index file with new task entry
5. Set initial status to "Pending"

### Updating Task Status
1. Modify the task status in the individual task file
2. Update the progress log in the task file
3. Move task to appropriate section in this index
4. Update the task summary statistics
5. Add entry to recent activity log

- **Abandoned**: Task cancelled or no longer relevant

### Maintenance
- Review and update this index weekly
- Archive completed tasks older than 3 months
