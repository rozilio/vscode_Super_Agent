## Memory Bank System

Claude Code operates with session context that can benefit from a structured memory bank approach. This system ensures continuity and effective collaboration across development sessions.

### Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files that build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

```
memory-bank/
├── projectbrief.md      # Foundation document - core requirements and goals
├── productContext.md    # Why this project exists, problems it solves
├── activeContext.md     # Current work focus, recent changes, next steps
├── systemPatterns.md    # System architecture, key technical decisions
├── techContext.md       # Technologies used, development setup, constraints
└── progress.md          # What works, what's left to build, current status
```

### Core Files (Required)

1. **projectbrief.md** - Foundation document that shapes all other files
2. **productContext.md** - Why this project exists and how it should work
3. **activeContext.md** - Current work focus and recent changes
4. **systemPatterns.md** - System architecture and design patterns
5. **techContext.md** - Technologies used and development setup
6. **progress.md** - Current status and what works

### Documentation Updates
Memory Bank updates should occur when:
- Discovering new project patterns
- After implementing significant changes
- When context needs clarification for future sessions
- When user requests **update memory bank**

### Project Intelligence Integration
This system ensures that each Claude Code session can quickly understand project context and continue work effectively.
